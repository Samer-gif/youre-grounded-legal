# Privacy Policy

**You're Grounded! Kids Game**
**Effective Date: February 20, 2026**

## Introduction

Welcome to You're Grounded! ("the App"), a fun educational game for children. Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect information when you use our App.

This App is designed for children and families. We are committed to complying with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and Apple's App Store Guidelines for kids' apps.

## Information We Collect

### Information Stored Locally on Your Device

The App stores all game data locally on your device using an on-device database. This includes:

- Game progress (scores, stars, streaks, achievements)
- Unlocked characters and scenarios
- Game settings and preferences

This data never leaves your device and is not transmitted to any server.

### Apple Sign-In (Optional)

If you choose to sign in using Apple Sign-In, we receive only the information Apple provides, which may include:

- A unique user identifier
- Your name (if you choose to share it)
- Your email address (if you choose to share it, or Apple's private relay email)

This information is used solely for authentication purposes.

### Subscription Information

The App offers optional premium subscriptions ($2.99/month or $19.99/year) managed entirely through Apple's App Store and processed by RevenueCat, our subscription management provider. We do not directly collect or store any payment information. Apple and RevenueCat handle all billing and payment processing. Please refer to:

- [Apple's Privacy Policy](https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/)
- [RevenueCat's Privacy Policy](https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy/)

## Information We Do NOT Collect

- We do **not** collect personal information from children
- We do **not** use analytics or tracking SDKs
- We do **not** display advertisements
- We do **not** share any data with third parties for marketing purposes
- We do **not** collect location data
- We do **not** collect photos, contacts, or any device sensor data

## Data Storage and Security

All game data is stored locally on your device. We do not operate servers that store user data. If you delete the App, all locally stored data is removed.

## Children's Privacy (COPPA Compliance)

We take children's privacy seriously. The App:

- Does not collect personal information from children under 13
- Does not include third-party advertising
- Does not include social media integration accessible to children
- Uses a parental gate (math challenge) to protect access to external links and subscription purchases

## Parental Controls

Parents can access settings through a parental gate that requires solving a math problem. This ensures children cannot accidentally:

- Access external websites
- Make subscription purchases
- View the privacy policy or terms of service pages

## Third-Party Services

The App uses the following third-party services:

| Service | Purpose | Privacy Policy |
|---------|---------|---------------|
| Apple App Store | App distribution and payments | [Link](https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/) |
| RevenueCat | Subscription management | [Link](https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy/) |
